The two XLSX files keep track of the angle that the hip and knee have during a ormal gait cycle. 
They include 99 values from 1% to 100% of the cycle. The .py file reads this type of files and generates an
animation of a figure walking acording to the data in the files. 

My values were extracted from the diagramm of the picture.
